## Introduction

Yes, that's the title of this first post. I'm genuinely afraid of labelling this a "blog", since it might actually hint that there will be regular updates here. It's.. Much like the anxiety C.G.P. Grey has about promising any/which kind of content release will be next, while his public persona on Wikipedia constantly fluctuates between being first and foremost either a "Professional YouTuber" or "Occational Podcaster".

## I wasted waaay too much time

Finding a framework for doing this thing is actually hard.


```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  println!("hello world");
}
```

```nix
let
  mkdocsInputs = with pkgs; [
    mkdocs
    python3Packages.mkdocs-material
    hugo
  ];
in
  mkdocsInputs
```
